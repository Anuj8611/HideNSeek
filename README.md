# 🔐 HideNSeek – File Encryptor & Decryptor in C

## 📌 About
HideNSeek is a simple **file encryption and decryption tool** built in C.  
It uses the **XOR cipher** with a single-character key to encrypt and decrypt any file (text or binary).  
This project was developed as part of my learning journey during the **NPTEL C Programming course**.
